##### 19 SEP 2019

### The Charity

A few weeks ago we said that we would be raffling off a Master capable account in order to raise
money for charity. This post will give you all of the details on how you can enter to win it.
First off, **all proceeds will be going to the <a href="https://www.lls.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS)</a>** which is a charity that does a lot of work funding research and battling to find a cure
for cancer. Any money going to this worthy organization has the ability to help each and every one
of us and our loved ones.

### How Can I Enter?

A raffle entry will be awarded for every $5 donation made. So if you want one entry, donate $5.
Donate $20 to get 4 entries. If you really want the account, donate $50 and you'll get 10 entries.

1. ***We'll be accepting PayPal transactions to Zrjones1984@gmail.com with your name/email
included in the memo*** so we know how much you've donated and how to contact you if you win.
At the conclusion of the donation period, ***ALL*** money sent to this account for the raffle will
be forwarded to the LLS.
2.***We'll be accepting entries from now through 29 SEP 2019***. There will be at least one
live stream during that period as well. Exact date(s) & time(s) will be posted to let you know so
you can check back on this site and/or follow Golf Clash Notebook on Twitter to get those
announcement(s).

There will also be a public log of submissions kept in a Facebook post in the Golf Clash Notebook
Facebook group page. This will verify that we've received your donation and that you've got the
appropriate number of raffle entries for your donation. Check back on this page for a link once the
post is created or follow up in the group page.

At the conclusion of the donation period, we'll do a LIVE capture of the donation being send to the
LLS as well as a random drawing to announce the winner. If you're selected, we'll get in contact
with you to get you the necessary information to transfer the account to you. The rest will be up
to you.

### Account Details

If you're wondering what this account brings to the table (think Level 7 Boomerang, Turbo Balls &
Level 3 Putter), here's what you're looking for. Scroll down to see the stats, clubs and balls.
The account still has a name change available so if you win it, you can rename it. It is currently
in Expert II so will need a little work to promote to Masters but has plenty of weapons for you to
do the job quickly.

If you have **any** questions, shoot an email to <span class="font-600 text-backwards">oi.koobetonhsalcflog@etubirtnoc</span>.

Good luck all!
