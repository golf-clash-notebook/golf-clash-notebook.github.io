      Ever wonder which holes are the easiest and which are the most difficult? That's what this
      tool aims to answer once and for all! You'll be given a series of 2 different holes and all
      you have to do is click the hole you believe is more difficult overall. Don't worry about
      which tee, par, winds, clubs, etc. Pretty easy right? The idea is that once enough votes are
      gathered we can get a list of all the holes, sorted by difficulty. The key is to get as many
      votes as possible so if you have some time to kill while you're waiting for your chests to
      open, go ahead and make your choices. The more input the better!
    </p>

      <strong>So where are the results? In the beginning, the list won't be very accurate at all.
      But as more votes are cast, the more accurate the list <em>should</em> become. If enough
      people participate, I'm guessing it shouldn't take more than a few days to get something worth
      looking at. At that point, I'll add the list to this page for everyone to see!</strong>
