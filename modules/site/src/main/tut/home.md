    <p>
      An open source compilation of Golf Clash content. Here you'll find past guides, descriptions,
      tips and more for the game of Golf Clash that may help you along your way.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site was built because there is a lot of great content on the web to help you along
      your way but it's all pretty scattered. This site attempts to organize it all so you can
      spend a little less time searching and a little more time learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is very much a work in progress and wouldn't be possible without the great work
      already done by other golf clash players. As you look through the site you'll probably see a
      lot of filler text. That's to let you know that it needs to be filled in and you can do it!
    </p>

      other pages that have a lot of quality content. And lastly, feel free to
