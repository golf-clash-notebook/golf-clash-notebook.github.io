    <p class="lead text-center">Golf Clash Notebook</p>

    <p>
      An open source encyclopedia of sorts for Golf Clash. Here you'll find guides, descriptions,
      tips and more for the game of Golf Clash that may help you along your way.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site was built because there is a lot of great content on the web to help you along
      your way but it's all pretty scattered. This site attempts to organize it all so you can
      spend a little less time searching and a little more time learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is very much a work in progress and wouldn't be possible without the great work already
      done by other golf clash players! Be sure to check out the <a href="/resources">Resources</a>
      page which provides links to other pages that have a lot of quality content. Also feel free
      to <a href="/contributing">contribute</a>, <a href="https://github.com/golf-clash-notebook/golf-clash-notebook.github.io/issues/new">create an issue</a>, or open a pull request at the <a href="https://github.com/golf-clash-notebook/golf-clash-notebook.github.io">GitHub</a> site.
