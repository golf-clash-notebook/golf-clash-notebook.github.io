##### 02 SEP 2019

### Site Status

For the last 2 years of this site, my family and I have been fortunate enough to enjoy good health.
Unfortunately those circumstances changed a little over a week ago, so I'll be taking an indefinite
break from the typical site updates that I've done for tournaments, hole maps, notesheets, balls,
etc. My current situation simply won't allow me the time required to continue as I have in the past.
For those of you in search of notesheets, I highly recommend checking out the ones that Vic Nesheim
puts together in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GCThe19thHole" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19th Hole Facebook group</a>.
I will do my best to merge any contributions to the site but at this point I can't commit to
anything. If anyone wants to step up to take the reigns of managing the site in terms of
development, GitHub, etc. just shoot me an email and we can discuss.

### App Status

I do have plans for some app changes in light of the fact that Playdemic continues to lie
and deceive when it comes to honoring their end of the agreement we put in place **nearly 6 months
ago**. You can expect some changes coming down the pike (mostly Android related) that will
reciprocate. This will require time, which I have very little of these days, to iron out some
details and build some tooling so I can't commit to any kind of schedule. But I am committed to it,
and expect that the end product will be worthwhile, delivering on multiple fronts what you guys are
looking for. Until then, stuffing Golf Clash in a secure folder to avoid their snooping is your
best bet.

### Account Raffle

More importantly, plans are being drawn up to raffle off my Golf Clash account in hopes of
raising some money to donate to a few charities (<a href="https://www.lls.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leukemia & Lymphoma Society</a>, <a href="https://www.bcrf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breast Cancer Research Foundation</a>, TBD).
**100% of donations will be going to charity.** This account is well equipped to compete in masters
in terms of clubs and balls so if you're looking for a way to get your hands on a beefed up account
while helping out a valuable cause, keep your ears to the ground. This will be happening in the
next few weeks and more info will be posted here and in the Golf Clash Notebook Facebook group when
the details are ironed out.

Wishing you all a happy and healthy future.
