title: Wind Chart Fixes
content: >
  An small error in calculating wind ring values has been found and corrected. It only affected
  minimum distance ring values for Wedges, Rough Irons, Sand Wedges when using power balls. The
  error was minimal but you may notice slightly different numbers in your wind charts.
