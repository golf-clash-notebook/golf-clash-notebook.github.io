title: New Wind Chart Variant!
content: >
  There's a new variant available in the <a href="/tools/windchartcreator/">Wind Chart Creator</a>!
  Instead of MPH values for each ring, you can get the ring adjustments needed for all winds up to
  16MPH. Check it out and see if you like it, and if not, the original tried and true chart is
  still available. Big thanks to Andrew Hodge for sharing his original work to create this!
