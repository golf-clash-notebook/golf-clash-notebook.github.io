      How should I spend my gems?

        In general the only time you should spend your gems is to buy balls in the shop.
        <strong>NEVER</strong> buy the Gold/Platinum/King chests available in the store. It's all
        random and you could very well end up only getting cards from Tours 1-4. You would be better
        off saving the gems and using them to speed open chests of the same level. Instead of
        splurging 4100 gems on a Tour 8 King chest in the shop, you could save them and speed open
        <strong><em>205</em></strong> Tour 8 chests once you start playing that tour!

        If you do the math, the King Chest would give you 107 cards with at least 7 epics, 44 rares.
        Over the course of the 205 Tour 8 chests (we'll assume 20% are gold which is a conservative
        estimate) you would receive at least 4264 cards and 328 rares. You would also certainly
        receive a minimum of 7 epics during that stretch and probably a lot more than 7. It's not
        even close as to which option is the better value. Just continue to grind and you're clubs
        will get better.

        So the point is, save your gems for balls, maybe an occasional speed opening of a chest and
        you can definately set yourself up for success.
