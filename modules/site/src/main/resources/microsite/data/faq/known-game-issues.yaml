  - question: >
      I checked a player's stats and saw their longest drive was an unrealistic number (like 1000)
      yards. Is this a cheat? If not, how did it happen?
    answer: >
      This is a known issue and not a cheat. A while back there was a bug that caused crazy wind
      (like 1700 mph) on some holes. The ball would blow completely off the course and crash the
      game.
  - question: >
      My opponent ran out of time on his shot, but somehow wound up on the green!
    answer: >
      This is a known issue and not a cheat. Occasionally your device will fail to receive your
      opponent's shot, it is a network sync issue. This makes it look like they have timed out and
      why their next shot looks so strange.

      I think I am playing a bot/replay. How can I tell?
    answer: >

        This is a known issue and not a cheat. The guaranteed way to tell is if you see the ball
        spin overlay flash up briefly just prior to your opponent's shot, as others have mentioned.
        You generally don't see it on their initial drive but it will definitely happen on most or
        all of their subsequent shots, including the putt. It looks like this or this, and will
        always show full topspin. You'll never see this playing against a live opponent, but will
        always see it against a replay.

        Another indicator is that your opponent doesn't use emojis when you expect, or send oddly
        timed emojis (they're just out of sync emojis from their previous game). The ball basket
        also might occasionally pop up in-between their shots as well. These don't always happen,
        but you definitely notice when you do.

        Also, replays where the player will run the timer down to zero, but it'll stay on zero for
        several seconds while the replay finishes taking their shot.

        And if it's taken more than about 30 seconds to find a match up, there's a good chance
        you'll be playing against a replay, which you'll know for sure as soon as you either see or
        don't see the ball spin overlay pop up prior to your opponent's second shot. This is
        possible.

          <strong>What happens when there are no players available in 1v1?</strong>

          Very rarely, in less than 3.9% of all games, there are no live players close enough to
          your trophy level to start a game quickly. In this situation, we will match you against
          an opponent with a similar trophy level who played the hole recently but who isn't online
          at that moment.
        </p>

          We are able to do this because we store the shots that players take on each hole they
          play. This opponent is selected randomly, and we try to make the experience as close as
          possible to playing a live player - the goal being that the overall win rate is in line
          with the live player vs live player experience. The outcome of the match will only affect
          the Trophies, Coins and stats of the live player.
