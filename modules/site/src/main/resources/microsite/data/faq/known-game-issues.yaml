  - question: >
      I checked a player's stats and saw their longest drive was an unrealistic number (like 1000)
      yards. Is this a cheat? If not, how did it happen?
    answer: >
      This is a known issue and not a cheat. A while back there was a bug that caused crazy wind
      (like 1700 mph) on some holes. The ball would blow completely off the course and crash the
      game.

      I think I am playing a bot/replay. How can I tell?
