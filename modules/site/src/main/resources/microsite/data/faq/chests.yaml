      What clubs can I get in a Pin Chest?
    answer: >
      Any club from the highest tour you have unlocked can appear in the pin chest. You don't even
      need to play that tour. For example, once you unlock tour seven, any club can be found in a
      pin chest. The tour you get your pins in doesn't matter for the clubs, but it does for the
      coins and gems. The higher tour, the more gems and coins.
