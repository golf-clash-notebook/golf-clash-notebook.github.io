      I adjusted according to the wind per ring calculation (1 ring per 1 MPH) but it was still off, why?
    answer: >
      The listed adjustment figures assume maximum club category power, and a level terrain. If you
      are using less than the clubs max power, or if the club is less than the maximum power of that
      club category, the adjustment is less. If you're shooting uphill the adjustment is less. If
      you're shooting downhill the adjustment is more.
