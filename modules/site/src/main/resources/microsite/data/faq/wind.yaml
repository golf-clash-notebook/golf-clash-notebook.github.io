      I adjusted according to the wind per ring calculation (1 ring per 1 MPH) biut it was still off, why?
    answer: >
      The listed adjustment figures assume maximum club power, and a level terrain. If you are using
      less than the clubs max power, the adjustment is less. If you're shooting uphill the
      adjustment is less. If you're shooting downhill the adjustment is more.
