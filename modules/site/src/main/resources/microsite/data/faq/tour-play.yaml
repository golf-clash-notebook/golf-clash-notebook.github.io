      How do I manage my bankroll?

        A good piece of advice you'll always hear floating around is to never risk more than 10% of
        your current bankroll on a match. That means to play Tour 4, which has a 3,000 entry fee, you
        should always have at least 30,000 coins in you bank. It's too easy to risk it all, lose and
        get stuck in Tour 1 playing replays that never make mistakes.

        If you're moving up into a new tour and lose your first couple matches (which is totally
        normal), move back down to the lower tour and build your bank up again. If you want to
        avoid having to move down like that, wait until you have 15x or 20x the bankroll you need.
        Whatever works for you. But once you go on a hard losing streak, don't just blindly mash
        the buttons to start up another game. Check how many coins you have left, and drop down if
        you have to. It <strong>will</strong> save you a lot of pain and frustration in the end.

  - question: >
      When should I move up to Tour 'X'?
    answer: >
      This is related to the question about about bankroll management. Wait until you have at least
      10x the tour entry fee in your bank. In addition to bankroll considerations, if you move up
      too fast, your clubs will quickly become overmatched by your opponents and you'll find
      yourself losing matches. If you're unsure if your clubs are good enough you can always fire
