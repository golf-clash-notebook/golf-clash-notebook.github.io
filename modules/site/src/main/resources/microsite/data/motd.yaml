  The Golf Clash Notebook Android app has temporarily been disabled on the Play Store. I'm
  extremely sorry for the inconvienence and confusion this has caused and wish there was more I
  could do to help but I'm on Google's clock at this point and it doesn't move as quickly as we'd
  like in these scenarios. I'm hoping to have an update for you all in the next few days but the
  amount of information I've recieved has been very limited. I really appreciate all of the support
  I've recieved from those of you who have reached out and offered to help as well as those of you
  who've shared how much you like the app. Unfortunately, at this point, it's just a waiting game.
  Most importantly, <strong>the app will return</strong> so we're still busy making small fixes,
  improvements, and adding new features to continue providing the definitely best Golf Clash app
  out there! Stay tuned!
