  This one sports the same stats as the Shell ball (with a slower OP needle speed) so it's a
  slightly better Titan best used for downwind shots where you push your drive up towards the green.
  And like a basketball, you can watch it bounce off the rim of the cup for yet another
  disappointing tournament finish.
