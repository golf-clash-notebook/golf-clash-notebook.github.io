  Another great tournament Par 3 ball with a useful 2nd shot kicker if you choose to use it that
  way. This aerodynamic little thing was originally available during the
  <a href="/tournaments/SouthCoast/">South Coast</a> tournament. Use that little extra bit of power
  to your advantage. Hopefully it'll compensate for your other shortcomings...or maybe not.
