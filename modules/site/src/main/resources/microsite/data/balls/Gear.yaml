  This ball was featured during the <a href="/tournaments/LaborDay2018/">Labor Day (2018)</a>
  tournament. While you may not be able to pound this one down the fairway quite as far as a
  Globe or Berserker, it offers you a much easier 2nd shot with the extra wind resistance it
  offers. Wind resistance isn't really your biggest problem though is it, Mr. Great Ball?
