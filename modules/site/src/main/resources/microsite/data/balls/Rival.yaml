  This reskinned King Maker commemorates yet another tragic collapse of the Americans on European
  soil. It's likely the European team were using these all around great balls to get a leg up on
  the Marlins sported by the American team. Rest assured, the U.S. will be bringing Royal balls in
  2020.
