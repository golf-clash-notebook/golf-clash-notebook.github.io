description: >
  The Autumn ball is geared towards downwind tournament shots where you'll still need to pull off
  a 2nd shot that will benefit from the extra wind resistance you'll get over using a Berserker.
  These were first offered during the <a href="/tournaments/FallMajor2018/">Fall Major (2018)</a>
  tournament.
