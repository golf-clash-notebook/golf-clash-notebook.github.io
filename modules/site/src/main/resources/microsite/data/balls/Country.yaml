  There were 17 of these gems offered right around the
  <a href="/tournaments/FootballFever/">Football Fever</a> tournament. While they are really good
  balls, they may be a bit expensive (500 gems per pack) for what they really are. But if you have
  them, they combine the best attributes of the Katana and Titan. Hopefully your country was
  available so you can let your opponent know which country has the worst Golf Clash players!
