  Long live the King! Playdemic decided to bring back the Dead Ball reincarnate and give you a
  fighting chance against the competition. Hopefully you stocked up on this one during the
  <a href="/tournaments/RoyalOpen/">Royal Open</a> and dropped a little dough on the cash offer.
  If not don't worry, it probably wouldn't have done you much good anyway...
