description: >
  These were part of a cash package around September of 2017 as well as the Touchdown tournament in
  early 2018. It's built for tailwind situations when you don't have a Berserker to spare. If you
  still have one, save it for tournaments so you can miss the weekend round by 1 stroke instead of 2.
