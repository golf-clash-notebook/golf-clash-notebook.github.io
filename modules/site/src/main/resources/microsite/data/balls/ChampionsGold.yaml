  This one (and a few variants for lower places) are awarded to the top finishers in the Champions
  100 division. No flaws in the one if you manage to get your hands on it. It may cost you a few
  100 King Makers to grind enough to get them, but you be the judge if the juice is worth the
  squeeze.
