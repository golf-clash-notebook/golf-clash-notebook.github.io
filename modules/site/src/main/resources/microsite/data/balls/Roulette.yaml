  The Roulette ball has the exact same stats as the Snowman Ball. They were offered for purchase
  during the <a href="/tournaments/VegasSundown/">Vegas Sundown</a> tournament. They can be handy
  in tailwind situations when you need a little boost to reach a distant fairway but still want
  some decent wind resistance for your second shot. With your short game though, don't expect these
  to change your luck for the hole out.
