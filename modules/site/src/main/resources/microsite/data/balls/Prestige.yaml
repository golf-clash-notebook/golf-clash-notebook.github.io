  This (worldwide) ball was avaiable for purchase during the <a href="/tournaments/PlatinumResorts/">Platinum Resorts</a>
  tournament. Same stats as the Origin Ball, but a slower needle speed on full overpowered shots
  makes this one a slightly better option for downwind tee shots if you're low on Berzerkers. It'll
  make those long seconds shots you buried in the sand a little more managable too.
needle-speed: 0.833
