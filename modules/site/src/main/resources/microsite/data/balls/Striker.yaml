  This is nothing more than a skinner Kingmaker, which makes it nothing more than a great ball for
  virtually any situation. It was offered as part of a cash package during the
  <a href="/tournaments/VegasSundown/">Vegas Sundown</a> tournament, and when you come up against
  one of these ball, my money is the other guy.
