  Reminiscent of a runaway train, it's a similar animal as the Berserker, minus the wind resistance,
  because wind resistance is for suckers. This will most definitely set some new long drive records,
  but I'm getting popcorn for the show coming in your ensuing shootout when you get stuck with a
  25 MPH side wind.
