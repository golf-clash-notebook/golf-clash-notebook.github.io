  This ball was featured during the <a href="/tournaments/Voyager/">Voyager</a>
  tournament. It's a very solid option for tournament Par 3's and Par 4's where the extra wind
  resistance will be huge on your approach shot. The side spin shouldn't be overlooked either.
  Your failed attempt to drop your eagle pitch should be overlooked though.
