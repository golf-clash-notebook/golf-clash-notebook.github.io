  This is a great ball to have in large quantity for higher tours (think 9, 10, 11) and tournaments
  when every shot counts. They're often awarded to top Rookie finishers in tournaments. The extra
  power makes a lot of challenging holes from the back tees much easier to handle and while they're
  expensive, you can occasionally get some in the shop if you manage your gems. In a perfect world,
  you'll load up on these from your first few Rookie tournaments and ride them all way to rock
  bottom during your next full tilt clash session.
