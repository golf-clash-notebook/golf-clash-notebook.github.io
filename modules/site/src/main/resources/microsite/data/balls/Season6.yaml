  Not the greatest ball but it serves its purpose in some tailwind situations. Shares the same
  stats as the Blue Marble, Gingerbread among others but this guy isn't equipped with the best
  OP needle speed. With you're timing though, who knows? Maybe it'll turn those 'Slices' & 'Hooks'
  into 'Goods'.
