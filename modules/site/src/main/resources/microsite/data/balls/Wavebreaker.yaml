  This ball was featured during the <a href="/tournaments/AmericanaClassic/">Americana Classic</a>
  tournament. Reskinned 5/2/1 ball. On one hand, it's got the best OP needle speed of the crop,
  but on the other hand, it's a wind 5 ball so you probably won't be using that feature much.
  There are many like this ball, but this one is mine.
