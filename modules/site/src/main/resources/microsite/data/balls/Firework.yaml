  A ball that was for sale during the <a href="/tournaments/ChristmasLinks/">Christmas Links</a>
  tournament. It's a replica of the Snowman ball so it's good for tailwind situations and with the
  attractive OP needle speed, it shouldn't be too difficult to keep it in the fairway trying to
  smash it as far as possible...but then again maybe not.
