  A really great ball that is perfect for head wind situations. It was awarded at the Rookie level
  during the <a href="/tournaments/CreepyCliffs/">Creepy Cliffs</a> tournament and part of a cash
  package around the same time. Good for just about any situation, but you won't be able to take
  advantage of any tail wind, just like you couldn't take advantage of the sliced drive your
  opponent hit last game.
