  This was the Pro, Expert and Masters ball prize in the
  <a href="/tournaments/WinterLinks/">Winter Links</a> tournament. It's got a simliar spirit as the
  Berserker but tamed down a bit which makes it perfect for people like yourself who can't control
  their drives. You'll ideally play this one on holes with the wind behind you.
