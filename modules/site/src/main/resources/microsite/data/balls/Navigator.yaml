  This is an affordable ball and a workhorse that you should ride through tours 7, 8 and 9 since you
  can finance them with the gems you get in chests. It's got enough wind resistance to make the
  wind in those tours manageable and the small power boost will come in handy on many holes. You'll
  often want to switch between Navigator and Quasar depending on the wind but both are good
  choices...unlike your decision to overpower that drive and let it sail right into the heavy stuff.
