  This is a ball that you can fund with your daily flow of gems from your chests once you get to the
  Tour 7 area. It's a similar ball to the Navigator and is usually the other option you can use on
  those early Pro Series tours depending on what the wind is doing. If you've got tail wind and it's
  a long hole, Quasar is often a better choice than the Navigator. It just swaps wind resistance for
  side spin. Now swap out your sloth-like reflexes and you'll be all set!
