  This ball was featured during the <a href="/tournaments/Mountain/">Mountain</a>
  tournament. This is a solid ball for tournament Par 3's and you want to stretch your wood to
  reach from those second or third tees where the Power 3 can be handy. It's also a good option
  for holes with a stiff headwind. Now go out there and get that par!
