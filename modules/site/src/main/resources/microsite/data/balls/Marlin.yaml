  This is a dirt cheap ball that you may want to break out in Tours 5 and 6 if you run into a
  vicious losing streak and need a leg up or if you're facing a stiff headwind that will make it
  impossible to reach the green in 2. The side spin it gives you can also be the difference on the
  Tour 6 Southern Pines shootouts when you're working with a driver that lacks curl
