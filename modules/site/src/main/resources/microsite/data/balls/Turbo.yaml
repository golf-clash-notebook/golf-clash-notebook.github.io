  This is the next best thing to a Snow Globe, just lacking that extra side spin. They were offered
  for purchase during the <a href="/tournaments/VegasSundown/">Vegas Sundown</a> tournament.
  Obviously suited for tailwind situations, save these balls for tournaments even if you can't
  save yourself out of the sand.
