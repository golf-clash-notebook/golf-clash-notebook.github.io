  Another ball that works really well for Par 3's. It was part of a winter time cash package and
  also awarded during the <a href="/tournaments/WinterLinks/">Winter Links</a> tournament. The key
  stat is obviously the wind resistance but the bump in power is nice for longer par 3's where you
  want to use a long iron instead of a wood. And most importantly, the animation looks awesome as
  it screams through the air and plugs into that greenside bunker.
