description: >
  This ball was featured during the <a href="/tournaments/FestiveCup/">Festive Cup</a>
  tournament. It's another ball designed for tournament Par 3's where side spin is at
  a premium. It may not have a lot of power, but there are plenty of Par 3 situations
  where it's preferable to have less power so don't under estimate the value here. Also
  never under estimate your own ability to clip the rough and give away that shot at
  a banner.
