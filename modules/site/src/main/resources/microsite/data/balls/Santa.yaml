  Just your run of the mill, maxed out wind resistance ball that was awarded to top Rookie finishers
  during the <a href="/tournaments/Christmas/">Christmas</a> tournament, and showed up as a prize
  for the Golden Shot around that time. Aside from the wind resistance, not a lot to get excited
  about...kind of like your short game.
