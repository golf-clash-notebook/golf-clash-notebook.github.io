  This ball was featured during the <a href="/tournaments/VintageOpen/">Vintage Open</a>
  tournament. It's a duplicate of the Season 2 ball. Save this one for some tournament holes with
  stiff headwinds or maybe a Par 3 where the power will come in handy. Just don't ask it to turn
  around that trainwreck of a front 9 you just got through.
