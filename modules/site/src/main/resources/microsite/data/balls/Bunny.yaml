  This ball was available during the <a href="/tournaments/EasterLinks/">Easter Links</a> tournament
  as part of a cash package. It boasts the same stats as the Mummy ball so it's best used in a stiff
  headwind to get your moneys worth. Pull it out in the tournament on a par 3 and watch as it hops
  into the hole. Not the regulation hole, the shootout hole. Because you need a little more
  aggravation in your life.
