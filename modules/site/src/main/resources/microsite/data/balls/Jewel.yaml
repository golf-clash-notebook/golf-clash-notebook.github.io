  You would've found this one during the <a href="/tournaments/DesertOpen/">Desert Open</a>
  tournament. It's got a great wind resistance / power combination but the lack of side spin is
  a serious limitation on this one so be prepared to use some curl. But it may be enough to tip the
  scales in your favor in a stiff headwind. Actually who are we kidding, you'll still find a way to
  mess it up!
