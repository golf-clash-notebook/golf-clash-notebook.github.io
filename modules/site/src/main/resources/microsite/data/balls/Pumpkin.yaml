  This is a reskinned King Maker which makes it a really good ball for pretty much any situation.
  It was awarded to Pro, Expert and Masters top finishers in the
  <a href="/tournaments/HauntedHills/">Haunted Hills</a> tournament. When your opponent breaks one
  out, it's just another reminder about how they did better in that tournament than you did.
