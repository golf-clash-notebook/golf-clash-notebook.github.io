  Arguably the best general purpose ball in the game. It was awarded to Pro, Expert and Masters top
  finishers in the <a href="/tournaments/CreepyCliffs/">Creepy Cliffs</a> tournament. It ticks all
  the right boxes and doesn't have any real weaknesses (except the lag on your phone that pushes it
  into the drink). Happy hunting with this bad boy.
