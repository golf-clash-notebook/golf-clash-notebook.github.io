  During the <a href="/tournaments/FootballFever/">Football Fever</a> tournament, these were offered
  as part of a cash package. They are a decent choice for a tournament Par 3 with the added wind
  resistance and a slight boost in power. And it also has a fitting name to describe the 3 putt you
  somehow managed to pull off against all odds!
