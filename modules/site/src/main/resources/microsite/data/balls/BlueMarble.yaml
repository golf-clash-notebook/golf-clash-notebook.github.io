  This ball was available during the <a href="/tournaments/EarthDay/">Earth Day</a> tournament
  as part of a cash package. It's a bit of a nerfed Berserker but still useful in tailwaind
  situations. If you look closely, you can see some of the clouds moving on the ball. Do you see
  it? Good! Now you've wasted a good 5 seconds that you could've used to hit a quality golf shot.
