  One of the best balls in the game, and also the most expensive in terms of gems. Many tournaments
  will give them out in Pro, Expert and Masters (at least to those who finish close to the top) but
  you'll also get one every once in a while in a chest. They're way to expensive to use gems on in
  the shop though. You're best off stashing these until you hit the upper tours (10, 11) and maybe
  using it on a really difficult tournament hole. Until then you can watch it spin in the shop while
  it taunts you about how you don't deserve to play it.
