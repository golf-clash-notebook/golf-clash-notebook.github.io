  One of the best balls in the game, and also the most expensive in terms of gems. Many tournaments
  will give them out in Pro, Expert and Masters (at least to those who finish close to the top) but
  you'll also get one every once in a while in a chest. They're way too expensive to use gems on in
  the shop though. You're best off stashing these until you hit the upper tours (10, 11) and higher
  level tournaments. Until then you can watch it spin in the shop while it taunts you about how you
  don't deserve it.
