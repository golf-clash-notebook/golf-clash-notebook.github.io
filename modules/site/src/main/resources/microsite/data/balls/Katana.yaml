description: >
  A pretty good ball but if you find yourself looking to buy some upper tier balls from the shop,
  you're better off going with Titans than Katanas. You'll almost always wish you had the extra
  power the Titan provides and rarely need the extra spin you get with the Katana. You'll also
  probably wish your opponent would hit the edge of the fringe and fly into a lake so they don't
  hand you your 4th straight loss.
