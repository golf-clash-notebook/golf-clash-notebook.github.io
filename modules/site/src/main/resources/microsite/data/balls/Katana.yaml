  I used to be in the 'Titan is way better boat', but the value of the extra side spin you get with
  a Katana can't be understated. Once you get to the higher tours like 10 & 11, side spin is
  critical on certain shootouts and if your opponent has less, you'll have a definite advantage. If
  you're willing to spend money in the game, the 'Fail to Qualify' tournament offers give you a
  nice way to stock up on these. And who are we kidding, you always fail to qualify!
