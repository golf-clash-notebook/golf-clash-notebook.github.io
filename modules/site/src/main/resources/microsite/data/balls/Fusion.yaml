  If you're feeling jilted by going up against opponents with Snow Globes, the Fusion ball should
  help you compensate. They were offered for purchase during the
  <a href="/tournaments/VintageOpen/">Vintage Open</a> tournament. It lacks a little spin and the
  OP needle speed is a little higher but this should take away all your possible excuses for missing
  out on the albatross.
