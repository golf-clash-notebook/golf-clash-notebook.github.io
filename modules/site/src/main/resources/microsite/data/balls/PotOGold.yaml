  This is pretty much a dressed up Katana with a bump in wind resistance. While this may not make it
  into the hall of fame it does make it a good ball for higher tour play, and it will definitely
  bring enough luck for your opponent to put their shot inside of yours on the shootout and make
  you run for that 3 stake special.
