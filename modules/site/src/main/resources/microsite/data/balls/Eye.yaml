description: >
  A ball from the <a href="/tournaments/HauntedHills/">Haunted Hills</a> tournament with maxed wind
  resistance that you should primarily use on par 3's. Just a small bump of side spin means you'll
  need to use it with the right club since you won't be able to stretch a long iron into a hole
  built for a wood. And after you miss that wide open green with a Marlin come tournament time,
  I'll be waiting to tell you "Eye told you so".
