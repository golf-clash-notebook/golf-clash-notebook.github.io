  Available during the <a href="/tournaments/OriginLinks/">Origin Links</a> tournament, these
  leather bound beauties have the same stats as the Blue Marble ball. This makes it a good tailwind
  ball if you don't have the Berzerker to spare or maybe don't need it. The epitome of 'Old School',
  they should suit your outdated and underperforming game just fine.
