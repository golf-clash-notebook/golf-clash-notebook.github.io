description: >
  This beast is tailor made for long par 4's and 5's with a tail wind. It can absolutely turn
  birdies into easy eagles, and eagles into chip in albotrosses. Unfortunately, you'll only find
  them in large quantities as prizes in Masters tournaments or part of expensive Black Friday cash
  offers. On the bright side, they show up as prizes in the Golden shot from time to time.
