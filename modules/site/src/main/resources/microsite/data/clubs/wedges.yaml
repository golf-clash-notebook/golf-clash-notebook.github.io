- name: The Dart
  description: >
    The first wedge that you'll unlock and use for the first few tours. It's certainly nothing
    special but the next 2 tours have epic wedges so you'll likely be stuck with this guy for
    a while.

- name: The Firefly
  description: >
    When you get The Firefly unlocked there's a decent chance that it will be the best option at
    least until you can level up your Skewer. The main selling points are the top spin and ball
    guide, which are pretty effective when used together. Max your topspin and line up your shot so
    it stops at the cup and you can avoid having to make any big adjustments for the wind. The
    accuracy is pretty low though so you'll still need to hit perfect shots to make it work.

    Arguably the worst club in the game. Not the worst wedge...the worst club. So if you were
    thinking about using this club, save yourself some agony and don't.

- name: The DownInOne
  description: >
    This is a pretty gimmicky club that you should probably never use in your day to day grinding.
    It <em>could</em> be useful for a situational tournament hole where you <strong>know</strong>
    where you might miss the green and dunking is the best option. Outside of that very rare case,
    this one can be ignored.

- name: The Skewer
  description: >
    After The Dart and Firefly (which you hopefully unlocked), The Skewer is probably the next
    wedge you'll use since it will have better accuracy than either of the previous 2. It's really
    a judgement call and your style of play that will decide if/when you switch from the Firefly.
    You'll get more accuracy and backspin with The Skewer but take a hit with the top spin and
    ball guide.

- name: The Endbringer
  description: >
    The name says it all. This is a really good wedge out of the gate with it's accuracy but you
    may have already unlocked and leveled up your Rapier by the time you unlock this epic. The only
    downside this club has is the amount of spin it has (at least until you hit level 6 & 7). So
    if you prefer the bump and run, go with The Rapier and if you'd rather float it in with deadly
    precision, The Endbringer is for you.

- name: The Rapier
  description: >
    Between The Endbringer and Rapier you have two very good clubs that will net you a lot of
    chip ins. If you're not using one of the two (save a maxed out Firefly), chances are you're
    using the wrong club. Use this club to stay under the wind and run the shot in for your eagle.
