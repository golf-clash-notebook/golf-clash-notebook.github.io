  type: Epic
  description: >
    Not a great club to start and because it's an epic, it's more than likely you'll never want to
    play this one. And by the time you manage to max it out, there will be a lot of other clubs
    that will be better.

    Probably the first sand wedge you'll unlock and it's too bad because it's one of the worst
    clubs in the game. It never really gets good so just hang on and suffer through until you can
    unlock something better.

  name: The Malibu
  category: SandWedges
  type: Rare
  description: >
    The Malibu is one of the two best sand wedges in the game and you should count on using it for
    95% of your games. The distance isn't great but the accuracy makes it very good at getting you
    out of trouble around the green and the ball guide is hard to argue with. Lack of spin can be
    frustrating at times but overall you'll like it more than you hate it.

  name: The Sahara
  category: SandWedges
  type: Epic
  description: >
    Given how fast the needle moves when you're in the sand, accuracy is a real import stat. The
    Sahara has very little of it so this is not a popular club. The distance looks nice but more
    often than not, you'll want the accuracy instead.

  description: >
    The Sand Lizard is an interesting club because it's the only other real popular option than the
    Malibu (until you level up your Spitfire). It ticks all the boxes except for ball guide, which
    will be a bigger deal to some players than others.

    Not a good choice. Even maxed out, this epic only sports accuracy of 69. At that point your
    Malibu will almost certainly be a better club. Back spin is not useful for a sand wedge so
    unlock it and move along.

  description: >
    When you're old and gray and manage to max the Spitfire, you'll have the best sand wedge in the
    game. Until then, it will be a situational comparison between it and The Malibu as to which is
    better. Come tournament time, when a long hole has lots of bunker trouble along the fairway, it
    may be worth packing this club so you can still reach the green if you find the trap.
