    The lack of distance means that by the time you manage to max it and make it a mediocre club,
    you will definitely have better option available. The only time you should be playing with the
    Grim Reaper is if your only other option is the Beginner Long Iron.

    The Backbone is a solid long iron to start off and starts to get pretty good once you get it
    to level 9. Thankfully it's a common so that won't take as long as other options. Most people
    will play this club or the Goliath on their way to the top. It all depends on whether you
    prefer distance or accuracy. In all the other meaningful long iron stats, they're pretty close.

    The other main contender (Backbone) in the long iron category (at least until you level up the
    B52 or max the Tsunami). The distance is very good from level 1 but you may miss the backspin
    until you can get it to level 5+. Overall, a solid option for almost any hole.

    If you're looking for backspin in a long iron, this is the place you should start. It does
    sacrifice some distance and accuracy though. You can pair it with a special ball on some
    tournament holes to come up with a good solution for some tricky Par 3's.

    Arguably the best long iron once you get it maxed. It lacks spin control when compared to other
    clubs which limits it's usefulness. Think about using this club at level 3+ for longer Par 3
    tournament holes where spin isn't necessary but distance is. In those situations, it can often
    be a better option than the Goliath because it's just as long, more accurate and comes with a
    really nice ball guide.

    While the accuracy and ball guide are nice in The Grizzly, most of the other stats don't really
    measure up to what you'll probably have available once you unlock it. Chances are you won't
    really use this one since it's a rare and will take a bit of time to become relevant.

    Can't really talk about using this one until it hits <em>at least</em> level 5 and even at that
    point there will likely be a much stronger argument to opt for the Backbone, Goliath or B52.
    The ball guide alone is a good reason to avoid this club.
