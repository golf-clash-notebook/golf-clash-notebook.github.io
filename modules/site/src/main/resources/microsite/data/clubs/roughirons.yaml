    The Roughcutter is an okay way to start your long lived affair with the rough. While it really
    lacks distance, the accuracy is good enough to get you where you need to be and knock in a few
    shots around the green.

    While The Junglist has plenty of extra distance, the accuracy should give you pause since you
    can quickly end up in the rough for your next shot too if you're not careful. Chances are that
    by the time you unlock this club, your Roughcutter will already be a few levels up and a better
    option.

    This is a situational club for sure. Save it for tournament holes where you may end up in the
    rough up by the hole but back spin is a must in order to put it close to the hole (e.g.
    <a href="/courses/SakuraHills/7/">Sakura Hills #7</a>). Aside from those limited situations,
    The Roughcutter is probably going to be a better club for you.

  category: RoughIrons
  type: Epic
  description: >
    The Off Roader is not a bad option if you manage to unlock it early. Compared to The
    Roughcutter, you get a lot more distance at the cost of accuracy with a nice bump in ball guide,
    which may be all you need to get a few more chip ins. Definitely depends on how far along you
    are in the game whether this club will be useful to you.

    The Razor is a very popular choice because of it's combination of accuracy and ball guide. With
    those two components, you have all you need to knock it in the hole from the rough. Just be
    aware of the limited spin you get early on. This is definitely a good choice at least until you
    can get The Nirvana.

    Use The Amazon when distance out of the rough is the absolute most important thing you need.
    You'll have plenty of distance from the start and the top spin gives it an edge over any other
    option when you need to go deep. Unfortunately the accuracy can bite you in a green side
    situation.

    This is the rough iron that you should be aiming to get and build up. At level 4, there's a good
    chance it'll be the best all around choice. At level 5, you'll get another big bump and it
    becomes a great club for going deep and taking on precision shots near the green.
