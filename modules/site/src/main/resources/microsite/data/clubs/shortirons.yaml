    The only redeeming feature of the Apache is the distance, and distance isn't exactly the most
    import thing you should look for in a short iron. Because that's really the only thing it has
    going for it, only use this club until you can unlock the Kingfisher or Runner. The added
    accuracy you'll get will be much more valuable than the extra power you get with this one.

  name: The Kingfisher
  description: >
    The Kingfisher becomes an OK club once you max it. Which is too bad because epics take forever
    to get to that point. You <em>may</em> want to use this club until you can unlock the Thorn or
    Hornet which are much better options overall.

  name: The Runner
  description: >
    Another club that basically just fills the space between the beginner short iron and The Thorn
    / Hornet. You'll never really need the insane amount of topspin it delivers and the ball guide
    is pretty awful until it's level 5+ so move away from this one as quickly as you can.

  name: The Thorn
  description: >
    The Thorn is one of the most popular short irons in the game. It offers good distance, a
    reasonable ball guide and all the backspin that you'll ever need. Just try not to get too
    carried away with the backspin because it can turn around and bite you. Chances are you'll
    have the most success with this club or The Hornet for you Golf Clash career so try them both
    out and see which you like better.

  name: The Hornet
  description: >
    Along with The Thorn, The Hornet is a very popular choice of short iron. It's accuracy is
    unrivaled and that stat alone will lead to a few chip ins that you wouldn't get with a lesser
    club. It makes a big sacrifice on backspin though so you'll need to get used to how the ball
    bounces and runs with this one. The ball guide is comparable to The Thorn so between the two,
    you'll have a good club to make a few eagles.

  name: The Claw
  description: >
    You'll probably see The Claw pop up from time to time in game, but for the most part, it's
    another club that you won't have any use for. The backspin isn't as good as The Thorn and the
    accuracy isn't as good as The Hornet. It also lags in ball guide.

  name: The Falcon

    This is an all around middle of the road iron that gets really good at level 6+. Keep in mind
    that this is an epic club so that will take longer than you're hoping for. At level 7, it's
    arguably the best short iron available and worth taking for a spin.

    This is the short iron you'll get in the Golden Shot mini-game. Somewhat similar stats to an
    entry level Falcon, meaning it's pretty average all round, except for a much weaker ball guide.
