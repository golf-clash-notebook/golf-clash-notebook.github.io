    Chances are you'll never use this club. It's not good at the lower levels and it's an epic,
    which means that by the time you manage to get enough cards to make it a mediocre club, you'll
    have plenty of other options like the Big Dawg.

    You'll likely be using The Viper through the first 5 tours. It's a common which means you can
    level it up quickly and the stats, while not great, are also not terrible. It's more accurate
    than the Big Dawg and has a better ball guide. Use those until you get a little more
    comfortable with judging how the ball bounces for a wood until you make the switch.

    The distance here is really good at the cost of poor accuracy and ball guide. Work on seeing
    how the ball bounces with spin applied and you can use the Big Dawg very effectively. It's a
    particularly good choice on Tour 6 since there are a few really long holes. This will be your
    go to club for long tournament holes as well until you can level up the Cataclysm.

    The first wood on the tour progression that has decent accuracy. On the down side, it's an epic
    and will take a long time to level up. This could definitely be an option for you earlier in the

    Backspin is the obvious stat that sticks out on this club and it's extremely useful in
    Tour 7 and 8 shootouts. It's <em>highly</em> recommended that you at least try it out on
    those tours. You probably won't regret it. The pain point of this club is the top spin so until
    you can max it out, you'll definitely run into situations where you'll need to over power it to
    reach some longer holes. Luckily, the accuracy is decent.

    This is the other option typically used in Tours 7 and 8 for those people who love accuracy and
    ball guide. This club is hands down the best in those two areas. It's also one of the worst
    options when you need distance and spin, at least until you manage to get it to level 9. At
    that point, the spin catches up and the lack of distance isn't as noticable. Definitely one of
    the best woods in the game.

    This is usually considered one of the 'Big 3' clubs that you should unlock in the shop if you're
    lucky enough to have it show up. While it's not all that impressive to start with, it gets
    pretty good, pretty fast. At level 3 it can replace the Big Dawg as your distance wood in
    tournaments (unless you happen to have the Big Dawg maxed). It's really not a done deal though
    until you max this club in terms of day to day. There will likely be a few other options for
    you.
