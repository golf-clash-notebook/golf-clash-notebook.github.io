    This is almost certainly the first driver you'll unlock. Switch to it immediately since anything
    is better than the beginner driver. It doesn't add any distance to start, but the added
    accuracy will keep you out of trouble. Beyond that, just wait until you unlock the Extra Mile
    and switch to that. Once you get this club to level 9+, the backspin makes it a possibility for
    tournament Par 3's from the back tees.

  name: The Extra Mile
  category: Drivers
  description: >
    This is the driver that most people use until they can unlock and level up Thor's Hammer or
    The Apocalypse. The distance this club has is unmatched except for those clubs. Of course, that
    extra distance comes at a price since the accuracy of The Extra Mile is pretty awful until you
    get it to level 7. Level 6 and 7 are significant upgrades and something to aim for to make the
    Pro Series tours more managable.

    This is a pure gimmick club that you'll almost never use except for maybe a situational hole
    in a tournament where there's a wide open fairway. The accuracy is awful and the carry distance
    makes it unusable for plenty of holes. Stash this one away and give your Extra Mile a hug.

  name: The Quarterback
  category: Drivers
  description: >
    For the most part, The Quarterback is the only club other than the Extra Mile that players use
    until they can beef up their Thor's Hammer or Apocalypse. It's accuracy is the main draw for
    players who have trouble landing the needle in the center but the distance can present problems,
    especially for Tour 6+. You'll also likely pull this one out in tournaments for some Par 3's
    when you start playing from the 2nd and 3rd tees.

    This is a similar club to The Quarterback but with even less spin. You'll get a little more
    distance and ball guide which can be helpful for precision drives in some tournament holes. For
    the most part though, this one probably won't see any action in your day to day.

  name: Thor's Hammer
  category: Drivers
  description: >
    Thor's Hammer is the first driver you'll probably unlock that might turn you away from the
    allure of The Extra Mile's distance. It gives you much better accuracy and similar top spin.
    Once you hit levels 4 and 5, you'll have a real pickle on your hands of which driver to use
    unless you've already leveled up The Apocalypse. This is a <strong><em>really</em></strong>
    great club once you get it to level 5 and a popular option for higher tours.

  category: Drivers
  description: >
    Hands down the best driver available once you get it to level 4 and even a viable option at 3.
    Unfortunately, the rate you get cards for this beast is slow at best so it might be a while. A
    <strong>long</strong> while. The distance is great, the accuracy is serviceable, the curl is
    awesome and the top spin comes in handy on more holes than you might think.
